This app is a shopping cart. It was used to build a friendly user experience with instant visual updates and scalable code in ecommerce applications.

## Description

The project consists of an ecommerce. It contains search filters by categories and you can access the details of each product. It is possible to add them to the cart and then complete the form to request the purchase. It delivers a unique sales ID.

I used Firebase how to database.

    1. Download the project from GitHub.
    2. Open the folder of the project in your favorite IDE.
    3. Run the `npm install` command.
    4. Run the `npm start` command.
    5. Enjoy!
